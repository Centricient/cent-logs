# cent-logs
Simple VIM plug-in that does some basic color highlighting of log files in the format Centricient uses


## Installation
This plug-in is [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) compatible. I recommend using it ;-) 

## Use
Once you install this plug-in it will automatically detect any files ending with a .clog extension and highlight them appropriately.
